6-DOF-Arm
===

A repo for my 6 Degree of Freedom Robotic Arm. A personal project funded by the OSU Robotics Club. 

I will be designing, constructing, and programming a modular robotic arm with six degrees of
freedom. The brackets, base frame, and gripper will be 3D printed and actuated using PWM
controlled servos. An Intel Galileo inside the base will command the servos based on input from
an external computer. This external computer will calculate arm motion based on
preprogrammed routines, user input, or simple vision processing.
